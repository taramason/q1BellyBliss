Hello!

This is a website that I designed and developed for a pre- and post-natal fitness and education center.

The client needed to take her outdated existing website, existing color scheme, keep the existing large amount of educational and informative content, but arrange it in a way that implemented pleasing UI and gave the user a positive impression of the business.

The client also wanted a mobile-friendly site without the need for the user to download an app.

Technology used was : HTML/CSS, Javascript and Jquery, Aris Weather and Map integration.  I utilized media queries as well as bootstrap (for grids only!) to create a mobile-friendly site.

This is an ongoing project. To see the current version, please click here: 

Thanks for checking it out!
