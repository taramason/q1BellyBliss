Hello!

This is a website that I have created for a pre- and post-natal fitness and education center.

The client needed to take her outdated existing website, existing color scheme, keep the existing large amount of educational and informative content, but arrange it in a way that implemented good UI and gave the user a pleasing experience.

The client also wanted a mobile-friendly site.

Technology used was : HTML/CSS, Javascript and Jquery, Aris Weather and Map integration.

This is an ongoing project. To see the current version, please click here: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bellyblissbeta-3171e/overview

Thanks for checking it ou!!
